## 👋 About me

### Professional Carreer
Hi, I'm Jack. I’ve had an affinity for technology since I was young (yes, I remember floppy disks). My journey began maintaining digital systems in media-rich environments, specifically within studios streaming to the internet. During my early studies, I learned a great deal from [Roland Sellis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolandsellis) and [Arno Kouters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnokouters/), teachers who truly loved their craft and passed that passion on to me.

Following that, my interest shifted toward the "hacker" side of things, leading me to study Information Security Management. This program taught me the intersection of policy, technology, and psychology in cybersecurity. During this time, I worked as a Cybersecurity Analyst, gaining deep insight into how a SOC/SIEM is built. A highlight of this period was witnessing the rapid evolution of the Microsoft security suite into a market leader.

After graduating, I began working as a Cybersecurity Consultant, which provided a crash course in the modern professional landscape. I was frequently challenged with unfamiliar subjects, which accelerated my learning curve. Later, I took on the role of IT Security Manager at a hospital. This role gave me a vital perspective on infrastructure; working in healthcare was particularly impactful, as security decisions directly influenced patient safety and health outcomes.

I continued my journey as a Cybersecurity Engineer at Orange Cyberdefense. There, I absorbed knowledge from ethical hackers (special shoutout to [Crypt0rr](https://github.com/crypt0rr)). This experience taught me that the cybersecurity industry is incredibly broad—it is impossible to know everything. Consequently, I decided to focus heavily on network operations, as mastering the TCP/IP stack provides the strongest foundation for cybersecurity.

### Outside the Matrix
I created the blog [plugntroubleshoot.eu](https://plugntroubleshoot.eu) because, in my experience, nothing in tech is ever truly "Plug and Play." For me, it is always plug and then troubleshoot. I would like to take you all on my journey of troubleshooting first. The goal of the blog is to improve my writing skills and in doing so, helping others with their troubleshoot. 

My Homelab Setup:
- Networking: Unifi gear
- Server: Intel NUC8i3BEH running Proxmox
- Virtualization: A mix of LXCs and a VM-based Docker host
- Connectivity: Tailscale (for secure and reliable interconnection)
- Workstation: Macbook air M3

To be continued...
