## 👋 Hi, I'm Jack
I am a Cybersecurity Engineer with a deep passion for Network Operations and Automation. My philosophy is simple: nothing is ever truly "Plug and Play." It is usually "Plug and Troubleshoot," and that is exactly where the fun (for some) usually begins.

## 🐧 The Linux Philosophy & My Homelab Story
I am falling more in love with Linux every single day. It brings me genuine happiness to realize that I am using a historical artifact built by thousands of brilliant, motivated people working together as humanity. Using Linux feels like standing on the shoulders of giants, and I am honored to be alive in a time where I can learn from and contribute to this ecosystem.

### 🧪 My Homelab
My homelab is the physical manifestation of this passion—a space where I can break things safely to understand how to fix them.

It isn't just a collection of hardware; it’s a living ecosystem. At its heart beats an Intel NUC8i3BEH, the resilient workhorse running Proxmox. I treat virtualization as an art form here, orchestrating a mix of lightweight LXCs and a heavy-duty VM-based Docker host to run my services. The nervous system of the lab is powered by Unifi gear, ensuring stable switching and routing, while my command center is a MacBook Air M3.

Recently, I’ve shifted my focus heavily toward Infrastructure as Code (IaC). I don’t just deploy servers; I automate their existence using OpenTofu for provisioning and Ansible (via Semaphore) for configuration management.

### 🛡️ Tailscale

A critical component of this setup is Tailscale. I use it not just for utility, but as a deliberate study in modern networking. From a learning perspective, in my field, understanding overlay networks and mesh VPNs is increasingly vital. Tailscale serves as a masterclass in how to simplify complex networking challenges—like NAT traversal and routing—without sacrificing performance. It allows me to treat my disparate devices as a unified, flat network, regardless of physical location.

From a privacy and security perspective, it acts as the backbone of my personal Zero Trust architecture. By using Tailscale, I can access my home services securely without opening  ports to the public internet. It keeps my digital footprint small and my access secure.

**🚀 Major Update (January 2026):** I am proud to share that I have officially become a Tailscale Insider. This recognition comes from my work as a co-owner of the [ScaleTail repository](https://github.com/tailscale-dev/ScaleTail), which has been adopted into the [tailscale-dev organization](https://github.com/tailscale-dev).

## 💼 Professional Career
My affinity for technology started young (yes, I remember floppy disks). My professional journey began in media-rich environments, maintaining digital systems for studios streaming to the internet. During these early years, I was lucky to learn from [Roland Sellis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolandsellis) and [Arno Kouters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnokouters) as my mentors who truly loved their craft and passed that spark on to me.

As my interest shifted toward the "hacker" side of the spectrum, I studied Information Security Management to understand the intersection of policy, technology, and psychology. I began my tenure as a Cybersecurity Analyst, gaining deep insight into SOC and SIEM architecture while witnessing the rapid evolution of the Microsoft security suite. Following that, I stepped into the role of a Cybersecurity Consultant. This was effectively a crash course in the modern professional landscape, forcing me to tackle unfamiliar subjects daily and significantly accelerating my learning curve.

Later, I took on the responsibility of IT Security Manager at a hospital. This role provided a vital perspective on critical infrastructure. Working in healthcare was particularly impactful; it taught me that security decisions are never just technical—they directly influence patient safety and health outcomes.

Currently, I serve as a Cybersecurity Engineer at Orange Cyberdefense, working alongside talented ethical hackers (shoutout to [crypt0rr](https://github.com/crypt0rr) and other cybersecurity professionals. I realized that the industry is too broad to know everything. Consequently, I decided to specialize in Network Operations—because mastering the TCP/IP stack provides the strongest foundation for everything else in security.

I look forward to future technological advancements; they keep my career interesting and my motivation high. Contributing to a more secure (f)society is what drives me.

## 🌍 Outside the Matrix
If you caught the Mr. Robot reference above, you already know I love hacking culture. But when I'm not staring at (error messages in) a terminal, I'm usually gyming, watching movies and series or creating music. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, I dove into FL Studio and discovered a new passion. I love making rap beats—it allows me to be creative in a way that code and security doesn't always permit. 

Besides that, I run the blog [plugntroubleshoot.eu](https://plugntroubleshoot.eu). I created it to improve my technical writing and to help others, because let's be honest: rarely is anything in tech truly "Plug and Play". When something actually works out of the box, I’m usually suspicious!
